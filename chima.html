        <P>From a tender age, I've been captivated by the power of graphics and designing, my interest in graphic design is not just a hobby but an important part of my identity. It's a passion that has shaped my life and my perspective on the world, and I believe my application would be incomplete without sharing my story.
            Graphic design, to me, is more than just arranging shapes and colors; it's the art of beauty and colours. Every design project I undertake is an opportunity to communicate, and inspire action. Whether it's a poster, a logo, or a book cover, I approach each project as a chance to convey a message, create an impact, and bring ideas to life.
            One of the most powerful aspects of graphic design is its universal language. It transcends cultural and linguistic boundaries, making it a formidable tool for bridging gaps and fostering understanding. Through my design work, I've found a way to connect with people from different cultural backgrounds and convey complex ideas in a simple and relatable manner. This ability to communicate effectively through design is something I will forever value.
            My journey into graphic design began from my internship in a graphic designing organisation. I can vividly recall the excitement of using my first graphic design software which was a common software known by all, it was corel draw and realizing the potential it held. Over sometime, I honed my skills by experimenting with various design tools, learning from tutorials, and seeking mentorship from experienced designers. With each project, I gained a deeper understanding of design principles,and color theory.
            One of the most significant aspects of my graphic design journey is its impact on my academic and extracurricular pursuits. In school, I've applied my design skills to enhance presentations, create educational materials, school presentations and projects and even assist in school events. Through various clubs and organizations, I've contributed by designing posters, banners, and social media content like my youtube channel thumbnails, amplifying the impact of these groups. My involvement in community service projects allowed me to use design as a tool for raising awareness and inspiring change.
            Beyond its practical applications, graphic design has been a source of personal growth and resilience. I've encountered countless challenges during my creative process, like client feedback. These experiences have taught me to persevere, adapt, and continuously improve my craft. My ability to receive and act on constructive complaints has evolved, making me a better designer and a more resilient individual.
            My passion for graphic design extends beyond the screen or canvas. I immerse myself in the world of design by following industry trends like that of canva and attending design conferences. I believe in the importance of staying current and pushing the boundaries of design innovation. This drive to excel in graphic design has fueled my academic and professional aspirations, inspiring me to pursue a degree and career in this field.
            As I reflect on my journey in graphic design, I am reminded of the words of Milton Glaser, a legendary graphic designer, who said, "There are three responses to a piece of design: yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for." Graphic design, to me, is about striving for those 'wow' moments, where a design resonates with its audience, leaving a lasting impression.
            In conclusion, my identity is intrinsically linked to my passion for graphic design. It's a meaningful part of my life, influencing how I communicate, learn, and engage with the world. I believe that sharing my story of growth and transformation through graphic design is essential to provide a complete picture of who I am. It's not just an interest; it's an integral part of my identity, driving me to create, communicate, and connect in a visually evolving world. thank you
